Now that the first quarter of the school year has come to an end, we’re here to recap on Project Edge’s latest endeavors. 

<!--more-->

This was the first quarter back to in-person school for many students, and as such, new challenges presented themselves. Having just adapted to the online environment, students were forced to transition back to in-person learning, which was rough to say the least. As such, this was one of Project Edge’s busiest few months as we covered subjects from math to history. 

We’ve also started resuming, or rather, starting up in-person activities as facilities begin to re-open. From lecturing at community clubs to running discussions at after school activities, we’re beginning to transition ourselves. 

With that being said, we have a few collaborations in the works, as well as upcoming programs to prepare everyone for the second half of this first, in-person semester. Stay tuned!
