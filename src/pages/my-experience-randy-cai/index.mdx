Despite teaching and helping to manage as a co-founder of Project Edge, I’ve come to learn a lot through my ongoing experience here.

Specifically, whether it’s tutoring biology or English and so on, learning about students and how to best instruct/guide during the impersonal period that was COVID was my greatest lesson. It seems like a lot of trouble stems from students’ inability to engage with virtual course material and reach out for customized feedback from teachers who are understandably very busy and shorthanded. It’s great to see understanding of homework or course material after going through problems with the students, especially in topics like biology where test questions can often be application based while simultaneously relying on previous knowledge. 

Learning from someone who’s already gone through the course material and can give personalized instruction is something very valuable, during the pandemic and beyond, and I’m glad to provide that to students through Project Edge.
