At Project Edge, I am one of the co-founders and curriculum directors. However, along with helping tutor students in a variety of subjects, I am also focused on the management and logistics side of the organization. This mainly includes keeping track of all information, working to manage scheduling, and managing ongoing operations.

Now, all these tasks may seem daunting at first. So how do we keep track of an organization with hundreds of hours being put in and manage tutoring sessions, given the busy schedules of our students and educators? Of course many businesses and organizations have their own methods of doing so, for example, using time clocks to record hours or making phone calls to schedule appointments. However, with our generation of young adults running this organization, we have implemented more tech-savvy ways to keep records of these things. 

For tracking volunteer hours, we use an online service called Clockify, which is similar to that of a time clock, but with it being online rather than a physical object. It has been extremely successful with keeping all the records of hours worked in one place, with colorful graphs to help visualize and present data. With regards to making appointments for tutoring sessions, we use a spreadsheet that automatically enters in the date, time, subject, and grade level of any student or parent that fills out the form on our website. From there, our educators can look at the time slots and choose a time that fits within their schedule so they can teach that session. Not only that, we also have a software program on our messaging platform that reminds us for when an upcoming tutoring session is. With this, there is no longer a need for our educators to reschedule due to double-bookings or time constraints.

These systems have made it incredibly efficient to run this organization without many problems. Finding and working on these technologies has taught me a lot about managing the logistics of Project Edge and I hope that these systems can allow our organization to run smoothly as we keep on expanding!
