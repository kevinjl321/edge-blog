With over 50 active instructors and 100 students worldwide, how do we keep track of service hours, registered sessions, task delegation for our educators? While many companies use time clocks to record hours or make phone calls to schedule appointments, our group of young adults running Project Edge has implemented more tech-savvy ways to keep our records.

For tracking volunteer hours, we use an online service called Clockify, which is similar to that of a time clock, but with it being online rather than a physical object. It has been extremely successful with keeping all the records of hours worked in one place, with colorful graphs to help visualize and present data. With regards to making appointments for tutoring sessions, we use a spreadsheet that automatically enters in the date, time, subject, and grade level of any student or parent that fills out the form on our website. From there, our educators can look at the time slots and choose a time that fits within their schedule so they can teach that session. Not only that, we also have a software program on our messaging platform that reminds us for when an upcoming tutoring session is. With this, there is no longer a need for our educators to reschedule due to double-bookings or time constraints.

These systems have made it incredibly efficient to run this organization without many problems. Finding and working on these technologies has taught me a lot about managing the logistics of Project Edge and I hope that these systems can allow our organization to run smoothly as we continue to expand!
