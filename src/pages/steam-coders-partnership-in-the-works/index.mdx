We are so excited to announce our partnership with STEAM:CODERS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to inspire underrepresented students in STEAM in preparation for academic and career opportunities! Their organization’s goal is to “introduce 1,000,000 students to the fundamentals of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), by 2045”; Project Edge supports this goal without reservation.

We all know that the pandemic has further hindered student accessibility to quality education; so, together we are developing the Math Pods program: a supplemental math course utilizing Minecraft as an educational tool for students at PUSD, JMHS, and more. Initial ideas include hosting academic competitions with fun prizes, incorporating Minecraft: Education Edition into the curriculum, and one-on-one tutoring with an emphasis on engagement. Stay tuned for further developments.
