We all know that the pandemic has further hindered student accessibility to quality education; so, together we are developing the Math Pods program: a supplemental math course utilizing Minecraft as an educational tool for students at PUSD, JMHS, and more. Initial ideas include hosting academic competitions with fun prizes, incorporating Minecraft: Education Edition into the curriculum, and one-on-one tutoring with an emphasis on engagement. Stay tuned for further developments.
