Looking back on 2021, we here at Project Edge are extremely proud of the students and communities we’ve reached, the impact on education we’ve made, and the fun and meaningful experiences we’ve had while doing it all. But above all, we’re excited for what 2022 has to bring—Project Edge is excited to announce new programs, collaborations, and more as the new year rolls around!

But first, a quick recap. This past year, Project Edge was able to reach over 100 students from all over the world, from California all the way to Iran. With our one-on-one instructional sessions as well as summer and afterschool programs brought in through working with organizations like STEAM:CODERS and EMWPEC, we’ve come closer to realizing our ultimate goal of providing a free, quality education to all. We’ve covered subjects from chess to public speaking, giving our students the chance to not only succeed in all academic respects, but supplement and go beyond a normal scholastic education.

With that being said, we’re here to give you a sneak peek of what's to come this new year! In summer 2022, we are planning on coordinating another program with STEAM:CODERS and their affiliated schools in Pasadena, namely Rosebud Academy. As for our personalized instructional sessions, we’ve recruited new enthusiastic instructors who will expand on our current curricula by offering courses in Philosophy and Arts History, just to name a few. And lastly, we’re in the process of organizing chapters across the nation as we return to in-person activities; look forward to seeing Project Edge in your area! 

To finish off, we’d like to extend our thanks to all of you: students, parents, instructors, teachers, organizations, and supporters. Without you, none of this would have been possible. From the Project Edge board to you, we’d like to wish you all a happy and healthy new year—here’s to another year of transforming education!
