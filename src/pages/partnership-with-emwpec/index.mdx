In late March of this year, our team had the honor of joining forces with fellow San Marino nonprofit East Meets West. Their organization aims to aid  immigrant families in accommodating to life in America, guiding parenting, child activities, and so on.

Notably, they are just as passionate about education as we are, and have generously offered to join our family as a sponsor! Members of Project Edge met up with East Meets West officers this past weekend and discussed the mutual goals and aims of our two organizations. 

Specifically, East Meets West was willing to donate $500: our projected cost for our first 6 months of operation. We'd like to thank East Meets West along with members of Project Edge so much for the support that’s allowing this company to grow and achieve its purpose.
