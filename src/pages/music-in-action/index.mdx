Ever since high school, I’ve been participating in programs worldwide at venues such as Carnegie Hall in New York and the Musikverein in Vienna, Austria. However, in my free time I have decided to pursue other opportunities locally. As a major project, I hosted a senior recital to raise funds and donate to an educational charity on behalf of Project Edge.

<!--more-->
The recital, hosted at The Lodge at Sierra Madre, was an event planned months in advance with ~50 people in attendance. As a result, I was able to perform and raise $1200+ for the nationally acclaimed charity www.adoptaclassroom.org. You may ask, why AdoptaClassroom? For one, because their mission statement aligns closely with the principles of Project Edge. Donations to AdoptaClassroom help put students back in classrooms and with appropriate school supplies. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, their funds were being put to use trying to diminish the education gap during online learning, just like Project Edge.

Now what about the recital? As a violinist, I played a program encompassing a wide range of musical genres and types. The program can be found listed below:

1. J.S. Bach - Sonata No. 1 in G Minor, S. 1001 - 2. Fuga
2. Johannes Brahms Arr. Josef Joachim - Hungarian Dance No. 2
3. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky - Concerto in D Major, Opus 35
4. Antonio Vivaldi - Concerto for Two Violins in A minor, Opus 3, No. 8, RV 522 
5. Frederic Chopin Arr. Pablo Sarasate - Nocturno Op. 9, No. 2
6. Carlos Gardel and Alfredo Le Pera Arr. John Williams - Tango (Por Una Cabeza)
7. Fritz Kreisler - Liebesleid (Love’s Sorrow)
8. Pablo de Sarasate - Carmen Fantasy after Bizet’s Opera, Opus 25
9. Joe Hisaishi - Merry Go Round of Life from Howl’s Moving Castle
