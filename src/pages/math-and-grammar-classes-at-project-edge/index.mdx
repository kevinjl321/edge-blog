Math and grammar are, unsurprisingly, two of our most popular subjects here at Project Edge. As an instructor and curriculum director, I greatly enjoy working with both subjects, but in my opinion, they seem like polar opposite teaching experiences. 

<!--more-->
To start with grammar, I mostly teach high school students who are learning difficult topics such as verbals, clauses, types of sentences, and phrases. The difficult thing about grammar is that all of the information will stack on top of eachother, starting from what you were taught in elementary school. The same definition of a noun being a person, place, thing, or idea is echoed when learning how different verbals like infinitives will act in a sentence. 

On the other hand, math is a hot topic for tutoring. As a curriculum director, I create much of the material that will be taught for math; however, much of the time, students will bring questions from what they are learning at school. This makes my job substantially easier because instead of going back to build their rudimentary foundation, I can focus more on the specific topic that the student needs help with. 

I enjoy teaching and creating curriculum for both Math and Grammar, and Project Edge has given me more experience to help the surrounding community.
