As Project Edge continues to grow, we would like to acknowledge one of the tutors directly progressing the democratization of education--Philip Leung.

Currently a senior at Flintridge Preparatory School, Philip joined Project Edge in his junior year after becoming “burnt out from playing chess competitively last year;” he hoped to use his skills for something productive and beneficial to others in the meantime. In his own words: “I wanted to ignite the same type of passion for chess that I had when I had just started playing. The pandemic was also a huge contributor: more accessibility, convenience, and I'm sure potential students were just as bored as I was.” 

To date, Philip has tutored over 100 sessions with Project Edge to prospective young chess players. His dedication is clear. Within Edge, he holds the record for most sessions taught by a considerable margin--but his commitment to education extends beyond mere quantity. 

“Tutoring is really rewarding because you can actually see progress. Chess tutoring is far more different from academic tutoring. While in school subjects, students may just be coming for help on a specific topic, in chess, everything taught stacks up and up. Maybe the next time you see a student for chemistry help, they're on the next unit. The things I teach are present constantly, starting from the foundation and basics. It's just really awesome when they've finally gotten good at the stuff they're learning. My students get pretty excited when they also realize they've improved,” he said, explaining his dedication for tutoring. To Philip, student enthusiasm is critical, and he enjoys knowing that students enjoy their time with him. In fact, his favorite part of tutoring is “emails from parents telling [him] how much their kids enjoyed the lessons.” 

Not only is Philip a proficient teacher, but he has shown quality as a mentor that his students look up to and genuinely connect with. “Of course, since my initial goal was for kids to enjoy chess, their enthusiasm is crucial. It's also fun just to talk about what's going on in their lives in the beginning of lessons. Some students are much younger so it's nice to talk about something other than chess,” he elaborates. Topics that have been discussed with Philip during tutoring sessions range from chess strategies to student science camps to a mutual fascination with spaghetti. 

With regard to a true measure of an effective teacher--real engagement with students--Philip Leung continues to succeed.
