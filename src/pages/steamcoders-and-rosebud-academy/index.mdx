Over this past summer, I went to Rosebud Academy in Pasadena, CA to volunteer as a part of Project Edge’s collaboration with fellow nonprofit organization STEAM:CODERS, spending three weeks there for a total of 25 hours of instruction. To say the least, it was a great experience.

I volunteered at Mr. Rosales’s class and there were eight students I worked with: Gabriel, Betty, George, Jerome, Artie, Randinus, Josephine, and Jordan. I tutored them in Math and English, working mostly with Gabriel as he was struggling the most. We completed four packets together each involving reading, grammar, multiplication, and basic fractional addition. Outside of tutoring my students, I also played basketball and tag with them. 

Volunteering at Rosebud opened my eyes to the impact COVID-19 has on some communities. Through my instruction, I really felt that I helped them achieve something. Without a doubt, I plan on making Rosebud Academy an annual volunteering location.
