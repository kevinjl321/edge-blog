With finals season quickly approaching, Project Edge has partnered with San Marino High School’s very own Science Club to host online, interactive group cram sessions, from 3-4 PM on Mondays to Fridays, every week of December until the semester comes to an end just before Christmas.

Sessions will start on the week of November 29 - December 3 and be held online by one to two instructors who will give a crash course of various subjects, from physics to biology. Each day of the week will be for a different set of subjects, while each specific review day will cover new topics, with time at the end of classes for students to bring their own questions. Registration will open tomorrow on the main website’s [sign-up page](https://project-edge.org/sign-up) and spots are limited! 

Once you sign up for a specific subject review day, you’ll receive an email from the instructor, including a Zoom link, brief overview of material that will be covered, and additional resources you might find helpful in your preparation process such as vocabulary lists and formula sheets. If you’d like to review a certain topic that isn’t covered or have any other questions/concerns, feel free to leave a note in the additional comments section when you register.

We look forward to seeing you all there!
